# hello-world
First time here, so taking this tutorial to test the water ;)
I am trying to work on simonK firmware to make it meet my particular need for my ESC.
I am not very familiar with all these new ways of writing codes.
I used to write little apps using VB back in the days... I hope to learn quickly!
